**Suggested Using**

``skflow``: One sklearn-type implement to run symbol learning.

**Advanced Using**

``base``:  The storage form of expression (tree-style), integration calculate methods, and define the present set for features and operations.

``flow``:  Genetic algorithm loop.

**For developers**

``preprocess``:  One "sklearn-type" implement to transform X

``gp``:  Genetic algorithm method

``function``:  Operation roles, Vector Operation, Dimension Operation, To define Operation

``calculation``:  Expression tree translation, Coefficient addition, Score


This API is aimed for user but not developer. Therefore some modules are just with brief introduction.
